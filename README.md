# BLErepeater

This firmware project was created using [Particle Developer Tools](https://www.particle.io/developer-tools/) and is compatible with all [Particle Devices](https://www.particle.io/devices/).

BLE repeater for RuuviTags

Works for me, YMMV

Note: you need to create your own ./src/Whitelist.cpp, see ./include/Whitelist.h for more details.

./scr/BLErepeater.cpp is the main file.
